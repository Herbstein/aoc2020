# Running

- Make sure you have Rust installed via [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

- Install the `cargo-aoc` runner via `cargo install cargo-aoc`.

  - This allows you to run `cargo aoc`, which will automatically download and cache the input

- Run the latest implemented day with `cargo aoc`, or run a specific day with `cargo aoc -d <day>`. Automatic benchmarking can be done with `cargo aoc bench -d <day>`, or `cargo aoc bench` for the latest implemented day.
